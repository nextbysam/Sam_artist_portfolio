                        I believe in being fully human. Let everything flow through you. Desire, suffering, beauty, rejection - without letting it control you. I personally don't like to split myself into a spiritual self that transcends the messy stuff and an ego self that experiences it. I'm one person(and hopefully you too).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I call this "stateless." It's just being human. Ironically, A lot of people suck at being human.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But there's one exception. One thing you obsess about mercilessly. Something your gut tells you matters. Something that only your bone can feel when you think about it. You can devote your entire life to it. You can be obsessed and fully human at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like to use a framework: if everyone started doing this thing, would it push humanity forward or hold us back? I want to be a catalyst, not an inhibitor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in creating, not competing. Competition is for those who accept the status quo. I aim for the revolutionary: solving humanity's deepest problems, not playing the game better. Like Steve Jobs, Tesla, Da Vinci. The ones who see what doesn't exist yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Be human and Be Obsessed.</strong>
